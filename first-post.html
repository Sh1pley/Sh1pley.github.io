      <h3>Module 1</h3>
      <p>Module 1. Wow, it all came and went so fast. Looking back its amazing the amount of concepts, ideas, and skill that can be taught and learned in such a short time.
        My favorite part of school offered at Turing shifted mid way through week 2. If asked at the end of week 1 what my favorite part was, I would have easily told anyone
        that the computer magic was the best! Taking logic, making it symbols and words on a screen and then seeing it do a thing is amazing. But not my favorite part anymore.
        Week 3 and forwards, my favorite part was easily the community. My cohorts, my friends in upper modules, even the instructors whose sole desire in Mod 1 was to confuse
        and challenge us. Coming from a community heavy background in the military and a large family, both being a father of 4 and a child in a household of 6. It was nice to see 
        the back and forth dynamic that is a tightly woven, similarly focused group such as our cohort of 1610.</p>
      <p>We started off as strangers in a stressful environment and came together as less strangers in a still stressful environment.. like a family! There were times you wanted 
        space, because you were either annoyed by or annoying the hell out of others. Definitely times that all you wanted was more time to discuss why in the F all your stuff wasn't
        working, and times were you just wanted to sit back, grab food and talk code and other nerdy things with like minded people. The stressful environment became less and less
        stressful as we began to lean on our new friends, discuss ideas and issues and succeed together. So all in all, big thanks to Turing and its staff for the coding skillz.. but
        an even bigger thanks to Turing for fostering a culture of inclusion, that has allowed us to learn together and succeed together! On to Mod 2.</p>
